# fromscratch 🚀

Hi, I'm Madhumithra 👋  
This repository is my journey of learning, building, and growing as a future software engineer — from scratch.

## 📌 What you'll find here:
- 🔧 Code practice (DSA, algorithms, problem-solving)
- 🌐 Web development (HTML, CSS, JS, projects)
- 🧠 Notes from learning (college + self-study)
- 🎯 Projects that I build step-by-step

## 🛤️ My Goal:
To build real-world skills and land an internship at a top tech company like Google, Amazon, or Meta.
